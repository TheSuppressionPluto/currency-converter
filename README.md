- **Multiple Currency Support:** You can convert between a wide range of currencies supported by the API.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The CurrencyConverter component provides a simple and intuitive interface, allowing users to select the input currency, output currency, and enter the amount for conversion.
- **Conversion Result:** The component displays the converted amount based on the selected currencies and input amount.
